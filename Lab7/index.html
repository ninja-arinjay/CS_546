            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Hello, I am Arinjay Panwar a Computer Science Graduate student at Stevens Institute of Technology.
                I am looking to start my career as a web developer and in the next five years, I envision myself cultivating my interest in the areas of Backend and Cloud Computing to build solutions for important worldwide problems today at scale.
                One particular area that I would really like to work in is using all of these areas to make an impact in the field of mental health. 
                I admit to being a rookie in all these areas but that tag is something that is definitely not here to stay!
            </p>
            <p>
            Apart from Coding the thing that I really love is  playing Soccer and watching Manchester United Games. Cristiano Ronaldo is my idol, I love the way he has worked so hard and acheived so many things.
            I just love the way he has been able to tackle his critics and always proven them wrong by his work ethics. I am really excited for the upcoming FIFA world cup in Qatar.
            </p>
