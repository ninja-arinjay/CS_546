        <h1>Tale of Troy!</h1>
        <p>This is one of my favorite stories in Greek Mythology</p>
        <p>Prince Paris of Troy stole away the beautiful Helen, wife of King Menelaus of Greece, the
          outraged Greeks were determined to win her back. The finest warriors in the swiftest ships sailed
          in a mighty fleet to the shores of their enemy. Eventually, hundreds of warriors swarmed up the
          beaches, laying siege to the immense, high - walled city of Troy. The Trojan princes often
          descended from their lofty towers to pit their strength against the Greeks on the broad plain
          outside the steadfast gates. Among the armies of both sides were the greatest heroes the world
          has ever seen. At their hands, the battlefield ran red with rivers of blood by day and burned with
          smoking funeral pyres by night
        </p>
        <p>
          After ten long years, even the Trojan princes Paris and Hector, and the Greek warrior of warriors
          Achilles, were ranked among the slain. Yet the Greeks were still no closer to breaching the
          towering, stone stronghold. Battle-weary, disheartened, and homesick, the great army was out of
          ideas - until the great king Odysseus hit upon a daring new plan. If they could not win the city of
          Troy by force, they might instead win it by cunning.

          Odysseus ordered soldiers to a nearby forest on Mount Ida to cut down trees and chop them into
          planks. Then the famous carpenter Epeius set to work with the wood. After three days, he had
          crafted an enormous, wooden horse that was stunning to behold. It was so magnificent and big.
          No one guessed it was in fact hollow. A hidden trapdoor led up into the empty body of the beast.

          At dawn the following day, the sentries positioned high on the battlements of Troy could not
          believe their eyes. Every morning for the past ten years, they have used to see the sight of the
          Greek camp spreading along the shore, their banners fluttering in the breeze. Their armor glinting
          in the sunlight, their ships filling the water as far as the eye could see. But this morning, the
          beach was empty! Or nearly - among the smoking heaps of burning huts was the incredible sight
          of the giant, wooden horse, standing still and silent on the golden sands. The sentries sounded
          the alarm at once.
